# Iter

This was an idea I had at a time to iterate over Elixir collections, but it is unfinished.

Instead, I later created the conceptually much more coherent [Extractable](https://github.com/Qqwy/elixir-extractable) and [Insertable](https://github.com/Qqwy/elixir-insertable) libraries. You probably want to take a look at those instead :-).
